## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(DBI)
library(dbplyr)
library(odbc)

odbcListDrivers()

con <- DBI::dbConnect(odbc(),
                      Driver = "SQL Server",
                      Server = "mcobsql.business.nd.edu",
                      UID = "MSBAstudent",
                      PWD = "SQL%database!Mendoza",
                      Port = 3306, 
                      Database = "ChicagoCrime")
